# Online-Voting-System
We have created 3 profiles : Admin Portal || Candidate Portal || Public Portal. Candidate can register themself on their portal, also public can register themself by their adhar card and finger print sensor, at the time of voting we are using finger print for the verification of candidate and saving their information in the database.
